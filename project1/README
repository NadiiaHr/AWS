Project 1
Analyzing Millions of Open Parking and Camera Violations
•	Language: Python
•	Libraries: argparse, sodapy, sys, json, requests, os, pandas, numpy
•	AWS Services: ElasticSearch, Kibana
•	Data: Open Parking and Camera Violations (https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofnewyork.us/nc67-uf89)

For this project, 508,479 rows of dataset from Open Parking and Camera Violations were loaded into an Elasticsearch (OpenSearch) 
instance and visualized with Kibana (OpenSearch Dashboard). Parking violations data is from 2008 to year 2020. 

1) Building the docker image 
In the ‘project01’ folder, I created a Dockerfile.

FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /app
COPY .  /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "src/main.py"]

The next step was building a docker image. I ran the following command in the "project01" folder in the command line:
docker build -t project:1.0 .

2) Running the docker image
docker run \
-e DATASET_ID="nc67-uf89" \
-e APP_TOKEN="wlnm5IJCJvLWeWW8oNG1bTSxQ" \
-e ES_HOST="https://search-project-modyamwv2cubdfmt45pna5pevm.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com" \
-e ES_USERNAME="xxxx" \
-e ES_PASSWORD="xxxx" \
-e INDEX_NAME="project" project:1.0 --page_size=20 --num_pages=20

3) Kibana Visualizations 
• Analysis 1 – Top 5 States with Parking Violations:

In order to analyze the top five states with parking violations, a pie chart was used. This visualization shows that New York state 
is the state with the highest amount of parking violations distributed (85.07%). The state with the second-highest amount of parking 
violations given is New Jersey (9.36%), followed by the states of Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Florida accordingly.

• Analysis 2 – Average Fine Amount, Penalty Amount, and Interest Amount by Year
https://github.com/NadiiaHr/AWS/blob/main/project1/assets/dashboard02.png

To visualize a trend of fine amount, penalty amount, and interest amount, a line graph was used. This visualization shows 
that the highest peaks for the average fine amount were in the years 2009 and 2020. In 2017, the average penalty amount 
was the same as the average reduction amount. The trend for the average penalty amount is that since 2015, it has been decreasing. 
The average reduction amount had the highest point in 2008, and it has been approximately stable since then.

• Analysis 3 – Top 10 Violation Types
https://github.com/NadiiaHr/AWS/blob/main/project1/assets/dashboard03.png

To visualize the top ten violation types, a horizontal bar chart was used. This visualization shows that the “photo school 
speed violation” is leading among the top 10 types of violations, in which 88,358 tickets were distributed. The “no parking-street cleaning” 
(66,434) had the second-highest distribution. Among the following highest types were “fail to display muni meter receipt” (47,033), “no 
standing-day/time limits” (37,649), and “no parking-day/time limits” (25,751), respectively.

• Analysis 4 – Total Violations

A gauge chart was used to visually show how many records were loaded in ElasticSearch. A total of 508,479 thousands of records were loaded.
